The project aims to address the need for a platform that effectively showcases the achievements of alumni. Currently, there may be challenges in how these stories are presented, potentially leading to a lack of engagement or visibility for alumni accomplishments. The need for improvement lies in creating a more user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and interaction with alumni success stories.
